In lightbox view you can use the arrows to navigate, or click on the photo itself to step forward. To leave lightbox view, just click outside of the lightbox and the window will close.

To run this script, simply start your server and open index.html. If you wish to change the flickr gallery simply change galleryID found at the top of challenge.js.
